That's it! Your builds are now protected.

## Trust Levels Explained

When you trust someone, you can choose how much access they get:

| Level | Command Example | What They Can Do |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **use** | `/easyclaims trust Steve use` | Open doors, press buttons, flip levers |
| **container** | `/easyclaims trust Steve container` | Above + open chests, barrels |
| **workstation** | `/easyclaims trust Steve workstation` | Above + use furnaces, crafting tables |
| **build** | `/easyclaims trust Steve build` | Full access - can break and place blocks |

**Note:** If you don't specify a level, players get full `build` access.

**Tip:** Use `/easyclaims trust PlayerName use` for visitors who just need to get through doors!

## How Claims Work

- Each claim protects a **32x32 block area** (one chunk)
- Claims extend from bedrock to sky - full vertical protection
- You start with **4 claim slots** and earn more by playing
- Open your **world map (M)** to see claims highlighted in color
- Your claims show in your unique color, others show in theirs

### Earning More Claims

The longer you play, the more land you can claim:

| Playtime | Total Claim Slots |
|----------|-------------------|
| New player | 4 chunks |
| 1 hour | 6 chunks |
| 5 hours | 14 chunks |
| 10 hours | 24 chunks |

Use `/easyclaims playtime` to check your progress!

## Installation

### For Server Owners

1. Download `EasyClaims-1.0.0.jar`
2. Place it in your server's `mods/` folder
3. Restart the server
4. Config files appear in `mods/Community_EasyClaims/`

### Setting Up Permissions

Grant these permissions to let players use the plugin:

```
perm group add Adventure easyclaims.use
perm group add admin easyclaims.admin
```

The `easyclaims.use` permission grants access to all player commands (claim, unclaim, trust, etc.).
The `easyclaims.admin` permission grants access to config/set/reload commands.

---

## Configuration

Config files are in `mods/Community_EasyClaims/`.

### config.json - Main Settings

```json
{
  "startingClaims": 4,
  "claimsPerHour": 2,
  "maxClaims": 50,
  "playtimeSaveInterval": 60
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `startingClaims` | 4 | Claims available to new players |
| `claimsPerHour` | 2 | Extra claims earned per hour played |
| `maxClaims` | 50 | Maximum claims anyone can have |

**Formula:** `startingClaims + (hoursPlayed × claimsPerHour)`, max `maxClaims`

**Tip:** Use `/easyclaims set` to change settings in-game without editing files!

### block_groups.json - Block Permissions

Controls which blocks need which trust level. Uses pattern matching:

```json
{
  "usePatterns": ["door", "button", "lever", "gate", "trapdoor"],
  "containerPatterns": ["chest", "barrel", "storage", "hopper"],
  "workstationPatterns": ["crafting", "furnace", "anvil", "brewing"]
}
```

Add Hytale block IDs as you discover them!

## Data Storage

All plugin data is stored in `mods/Community_EasyClaims/`:

```
mods/Community_EasyClaims/
├── config.json          # Main settings
├── block_groups.json    # Block permission rules
├── claims/
│   ├── index.json       # Quick lookup of all claims
│   └── <uuid>.json      # Each player's claims & trusted players
└── playtime/
    └── <uuid>.json      # Each player's playtime
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "You don't have permission"
Ask your server admin to grant you the `easyclaims.use` permission.

### Claims not showing on map?
Try closing and reopening your map, or reconnect to the server.

### Can't claim?
- Check if you have available slots: `/easyclaims playtime`
- Make sure the chunk isn't already claimed by someone else

### Protection not working?
Check server console for `[EasyClaims]` messages to debug block events.
